# Disaster-Management
Disaster Preparedness Web Application A Python-driven website to enhance disaster readiness, utilizing a SQLite database for data management and modular utility functions for streamlined operations. Built for accessibility and efficiency.

##Steps to Run the Project
1. Install Required Software:
Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.
Install a SQLite client if needed (optional, for direct database access).
  
2. Set Up the Environment:
Navigate to the project directory:
  cd path/to/PROJECT_OG
Install required Python libraries:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
If requirements.txt is missing, manually install libraries based on imports in app.py and Util_Functions.py.

3. Verify the Database:
Ensure the disaster_preparedness.db file is in the correct location (same directory as app.py).
If the database requires initial setup, check for scripts or commands in the project documentation or code.

4. Run the Application:
Start the main application by running:
  python app.py
Follow any instructions displayed in the console or web interface.

5. Access the Application:
If it's a web application, open your browser and go to the specified URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000 for Flask-based projects).
If it's a console-based app, interact directly in the terminal.

6. Explore Utility Functions:
Review Util_Functions.py for additional tools or scripts that support the main application.


Notes
If the project uses a specific framework (e.g., Flask, Django), additional setup might be required, such as configuring routes or templates.
Check for any README or documentation files in the project for tailored instructions.
